## ðŸ“‹ Development Checklist

Before implementing any feature, ensure you've reviewed:

- [ ] **Module 1**: Project context and educational objectives clear
- [ ] **Module 3**: Child safety requirements understood and planned
- [ ] **Specific Module**: Relevant specialized patterns identified
- [ ] **Module 4**: Documentation automation triggers configured
- [ ] **Module 7**: Quality assurance processes ready

## ðŸŽ¯ Educational Game Principles (Always Apply)

### Core Values
1. **Child Safety First**: Every decision prioritizes 12-year-old safety and wellbeing
2. **Educational Excellence**: Every feature teaches something valuable
3. **Encouraging Experience**: All feedback is positive and supportive
4. **Cultural Respect**: All content is culturally sensitive and inclusive
5. **Accessibility**: Designed for all children regardless of abilities

### Technical Standards
1. **Mobile-First**: Optimized for tablets and mobile devices children use
2. **Performance**: < 2 second load times for maintaining attention
3. **COPPA Compliance**: Strict privacy protection and parental controls
4. **LTS Stability**: .NET 8 LTS versions for reliability
5. **Documentation**: Automatic generation of educational and technical docs

### Development Process
1. **95% AI Autonomy**: Let AI handle implementation details
2. **5% Human Guidance**: Focus on educational validation and creative direction
3. **Iterative Improvement**: Continuous learning and enhancement
4. **Safety Validation**: Multiple layers of content and behavior checking
5. **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing for educational effectiveness

## ðŸ”„ Module Update Process

### When to Update Modules
- New educational requirements discovered
- Child safety regulations change
- Technology stack evolves
- User feedback indicates improvements needed
- Educational effectiveness data suggests enhancements

### Update Workflow
1. Identify which modules need updates
2. Update module content with new patterns or requirements
3. Test changes with sample implementations
4. Update this coordinator file with any new guidance
5. Document changes in development journal

## ðŸ“ž Module Interaction Patterns

### Cross-Module Dependencies
- **All modules depend on Module 1** for foundational context
- **All content-facing modules require Module 3** for safety compliance
- **UI modules often need Module 2** for educational patterns
- **Implementation modules benefit from Module 4** for documentation
- **All modules should consider Module 7** for quality processes

### Conflict Resolution
If modules provide conflicting guidance:
1. **Child Safety (Module 3) always wins** - safety is non-negotiable
2. **Educational Value (Module 2) takes priority** over convenience
3. **Foundation principles (Module 1)** guide all decisions
4. **When in doubt, choose the more restrictive, safer option**
