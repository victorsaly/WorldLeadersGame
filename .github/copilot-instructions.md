- **Child-Friendly Language**: Age-appropriate for 12-year-olds where relevant
- **Technical Accuracy**: All code examples must be tested and functional
- **Professional Presentation**: Use proper markdown formatting and structure
- **Cross-Linking**: Include relevant internal links between documents

#### **File Organization Rules**

- **Never create duplicate files** with similar names (e.g., `testing.md` vs `LOCAL-TESTING.md`)
- **Use collections for series content** (`_posts/`, `_journey/`, `_technical/`, `_milestones/`)
- **Keep root directory clean** - only essential navigation files
- **Assets in `/assets/`** - all images, CSS, JS files
- **Scripts have clear purposes** - no duplicate functionality

#### **Update Triggers**

AI must update documentation when:

- New code patterns are established
- Game mechanics are implemented
- Educational content is added
- Development workflow changes

- Architecture decisions are made

#### **Current Clean Structure (DO NOT MODIFY)**

The documentation structure has been carefully organized. DO NOT create duplicate files or change this structure:

```
docs/
├── _posts/                     # Blog posts: YYYY-MM-DD-title.md
├── _journey/                   # Journey logs: week-##-title.md
├── _technical/                 # Technical guides: lowercase-with-hyphens.md
├── _milestones/                # Milestones: milestone-##-title.md
├── assets/                     # Static assets only
├── index.md                    # Homepage (DO NOT DUPLICATE)
├── blog.md                     # Blog index
├── journey.md                  # Journey index
├── technical-docs.md           # Technical index
├── about.md                    # Project info
├── LOCAL-TESTING.md            # Testing guide (UPPERCASE - special file)
├── simple-test.sh              # Auto-detect test script
├── test-docker.sh              # Docker-based testing
├── verify-structure.sh         # Documentation structure verification
├── Gemfile                     # Jekyll dependencies

```

**NEVER CREATE**:

- Duplicate README files
- Summary files (use collections instead)
- Mixed case files (except special UPPERCASE guides)
- Additional test scripts
- Files outside this structure

**STRUCTURE VERIFICATION**:
Run `./verify-structure.sh` to ensure documentation compliance.

#### **Documentation Workflow for AI**

When AI needs to create or update documentation:

1. **Identify the content type**:

   - Weekly progress → `_journey/week-##-title.md`
   - Technical implementation → `_technical/lowercase-with-hyphens.md`
   - Blog post → `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
   - Milestone → `_milestones/milestone-##-title.md`

2. **Use correct frontmatter** (see templates above)

3. **Follow naming conventions strictly**:

   - Collections: `lowercase-with-hyphens.md`
   - Dates: `YYYY-MM-DD-` prefix for posts
   - Numbers: `week-01`, `milestone-02` (zero-padded)

4. **Update existing files instead of creating new ones** when content belongs to existing documents

5. **Cross-link appropriately** between related documents

6. **Never duplicate functionality** - use existing files and update them

### **GitHub Copilot Commit Generation**

When generating commit messages, always:

1. **Start with appropriate type and scope**
2. **Use imperative mood** ("add feature" not "added feature")
3. **Include educational context** for game-related commits
4. **Reference issues** when closing or addressing them
5. **Add breaking change notes** when applicable
6. **Keep subject line under 72 characters**
7. **Include body for complex changes** explaining educational rationale

### **Git Workflow Standards**

#### **Rebase-Only Policy**

This project follows a **rebase-only workflow** to maintain a clean, linear git history:

```bash
# ✅ ALWAYS use rebase instead of merge
git pull --rebase origin main
git rebase main

# 🚫 NEVER use merge commits
git pull origin main  # creates merge commits
git merge main        # creates merge commits
```

#### **Branch Management**

```bash
# Creating feature branches
git checkout -b docs/feature-name
git checkout -b feat/feature-name
git checkout -b fix/bug-description

# Updating feature branch with latest main
git checkout main
git pull --rebase origin main
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main

# Before creating PR - clean up commits
git rebase -i HEAD~n  # squash/reword commits as needed
```

#### **Pull Request Workflow**

1. **Create feature branch** with descriptive name following conventional patterns
2. **Make commits** following Conventional Commits specification
3. **Rebase onto main** before creating PR to ensure linear history
4. **Squash related commits** using interactive rebase if needed
5. **Create PR** with clear description and educational context
6. **Rebase and merge** (not merge commit) when PR is approved

#### **GitHub Repository Settings**

Configure repository to enforce rebase-only workflow:

```json
{
  "merge_commit_allowed": false,
  "squash_merge_allowed": true,
  "rebase_merge_allowed": true,
  "default_merge_method": "rebase"
}
```

#### **Pre-commit Hooks Configuration**

```bash
# Install commitlint for automated commit message validation
npm install --save-dev @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional

# .commitlintrc.json
{
  "extends": ["@commitlint/config-conventional"],
  "rules": {
    "type-enum": [2, "always", [
      "feat", "fix", "docs", "style", "refactor", "test", "chore",
      "game", "ai", "safety", "data", "speech", "ui"
    ]]
  }
}
```

### **Examples for AI-Generated Commits**

```bash
# When AI generates new educational content
feat(agents): implement Fortune Teller AI with mystical educational guidance

# When AI fixes child safety issues
safety(validation): resolve content moderation for inappropriate responses

# When AI creates new game mechanics
game(progression): add reputation-based territory unlock system

# When AI updates documentation
docs(prompts): enhance AI instruction patterns for educational content

# When AI improves child-friendly UI
ui(accessibility): improve screen reader support for dice component
```

This ensures all AI-generated commits maintain consistency and provide clear context for the educational game development journey.
