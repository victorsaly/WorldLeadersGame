## üéØ Mandatory Documentation Triggers

### EVERY New Feature MUST Trigger:

#### 1. Feature Implementation Documentation
- **Location**: Update relevant `_technical/` guide
- **Content**: Educational context, real-world application, code examples
- **Timeline**: Completed within same development session

#### 2. Journey Documentation Update
- **Location**: Current week's `_journey/week-##-title.md`
- **Content**: Educational outcomes achieved, AI autonomy percentage
- **Timeline**: Updated at end of each development day

#### 3. Cross-Reference Updates
- **Action**: Link new content to related documentation
- **Navigation**: Update internal references and mobile-friendly formatting
- **Quality**: Ensure educational value preserved

#### 4. Blog Post Creation (Major Features)
- **Location**: `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
- **Focus**: Educational methodology and AI collaboration insights
- **Audience**: External educational technology community

## üìã File Naming Conventions

### Collections (CRITICAL)
- **Format**: `lowercase-with-hyphens.md`
- **Examples**:

  - `ai-prompt-engineering.md`
  - `dice-rolling-implementation.md`

### Root Pages
- **Format**: `lowercase-with-hyphens.md`
- **Examples**: `index.md`, `technical-docs.md`

### Special Files
- **Format**: `UPPERCASE.md` for important guides
- **Examples**: `LOCAL-TESTING.md`, `README.md`

### Scripts
- **Format**: `lowercase-with-hyphens.sh`
- **Examples**: `simple-test.sh`, `test-docker.sh`

## üîÑ Documentation Workflow Process

### For Every New Feature:

#### Step 1: Feature Planning Documentation
```markdown
# Feature: [Name]
**Educational Objective**: [What this teaches 12-year-olds]
**Real-World Connection**: [How this applies to geography/economics/language]
**Implementation Approach**: [Technical strategy]
**Safety Considerations**: [Child protection measures]
```

#### Step 2: Implementation Documentation
- **Code Examples**: Include educational context comments
- **Learning Outcomes**: Document what children learn
- **Testing Strategy**: Verify educational effectiveness
- **Safety Validation**: Confirm age-appropriate content

#### Step 3: Journey Update
```markdown
## [Date] - [Feature Name] Implementation
**Educational Value Added**: [Specific learning outcomes]
**AI Autonomy**: [Percentage of AI-generated vs human-guided work]
**Challenges Overcome**: [Technical and educational challenges]
**Next Steps**: [Follow-up educational opportunities]
```

#### Step 4: Cross-Reference Integration
- Update navigation between related documents
- Add internal links to support learning progression
- Ensure mobile-friendly formatting for tablet use

## üìä Quality Standards

### Educational Value Requirements
- **Learning Objectives**: Every document must teach something specific
- **Age-Appropriate Language**: Suitable for 12-year-olds where relevant
- **Real-World Application**: Connect to actual geography, economics, or language learning
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Respectful representation of all countries and cultures

### Technical Documentation Standards
- **Code Examples**: Must be tested and functional
- **Comments**: Include educational context in code comments
- **Error Handling**: Document child-safety considerations
- **Performance**: Include age-appropriate timing expectations

### Professional Presentation
- **Markdown Formatting**: Proper headers, lists, code blocks
