**Use This Module**: When implementing game features, mechanics, progression systems, or educational content.

---

## üé≤ Core Game Mechanics

### Career Progression System
- **Dice Roll Mechanics**: 1-6 determines job advancement
  - **1-2**: Farmer/Gardener (entry level)
  - **3-4**: Shopkeeper/Artisan (middle level)  
  - **5-6**: Politician/Business Leader (leadership level)
- **Income Generation**: Monthly earnings from current job + territories
- **Educational Value**: Teaches probability, career progression, and economic planning

### Resource Management Framework
```csharp
public class GameResources
{
    public int Income { get; set; }        // Monthly earnings
    public int Reputation { get; set; }    // 0-100% scale
    public int Happiness { get; set; }     // Population satisfaction 0-100%
}
```

### Territory Acquisition System
- **GDP-Based Pricing**: Real World Bank data determines territory costs
- **Reputation Requirements**: Higher-value territories require better reputation
- **Educational Integration**: Teaches economics, geography, and strategic planning

## üåç Real-World Data Integration

### Territory Pricing Tiers
```csharp
public enum TerritoryTier
{
    Small,    // GDP rank 100+ - Easy acquisition ($5K, 10% reputation)
    Medium,   // GDP rank 30-100 - Moderate difficulty ($50K, 40% reputation)
    Major     // GDP rank 1-30 - High requirements ($200K, 85% reputation)
}
```

### Educational Examples
- **Nepal**: $5K cost, 10% reputation required (introduces basic concepts)
- **Canada**: $50K cost, 40% reputation required (intermediate strategy)
- **USA**: $200K cost, 85% reputation required (advanced planning)

## üéØ Game Flow Design

### Turn-Based Progression
1. **Career Phase**: Dice roll determines job advancement
2. **Event Phase**: Random card-based events affect resources
3. **Strategy Phase**: AI Fortune Teller provides guidance
4. **Action Phase**: Player chooses territory purchases or other actions
5. **Resolution Phase**: Update resources and check win/loss conditions

### Win/Loss Conditions
- **Victory**: Achieve 100% reputation OR acquire all territories
- **Defeat**: Happiness drops to zero OR inability to recover from setbacks
- **Educational Value**: Teaches consequence management and strategic thinking

## ü§ñ AI Agent Educational Personalities

### Agent System Design
```csharp
public enum AgentType
{
    CareerGuide,        // Encouraging mentor for job progression
    EventNarrator,      // Dramatic storyteller for random events
    FortuneTeller,      // Mystical advisor for strategic insights
    HappinessAdvisor,   // Caring diplomat for population management
    TerritoryStrategist, // Military strategist for expansion planning
    LanguageTutor       // Patient teacher for pronunciation practice
}
```

### Educational Agent Patterns
```csharp
public class EducationalAgent
{
    public AgentType Type { get; set; }
    public string PersonalityTrait { get; set; }  // "encouraging", "mystical", etc.
    public string EducationalFocus { get; set; }  // Learning objective
    public List<string> SafeResponses { get; set; } // Fallback content
}
```

## üó∫Ô∏è Language Learning Integration

### Speech Recognition Features
- **Country-Specific Languages**: Learn pronunciations for owned territories
- **Pronunciation Assessment**: Azure Speech Services for detailed feedback
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor improvement over time with encouragement
- **Cultural Context**: Connect language learning to geographical knowledge

### Implementation Pattern
```csharp
public class LanguageLearningChallenge
{
    public string CountryCode { get; set; }
    public string TargetWord { get; set; }
    public string PhoneticGuide { get; set; }
    public int DifficultyLevel { get; set; }  // 1-3 for age-appropriate progression
    public string CulturalContext { get; set; }  // Educational background
}
```

## üé™ Event System Design

### Random Event Categories
- **Career Events**: Job opportunities, skill development
- **Economic Events**: Market changes affecting income
- **Diplomatic Events**: International relations affecting reputation
- **Cultural Events**: Language learning opportunities
- **Natural Events**: Geographic challenges teaching problem-solving

### Educational Event Template
```csharp
public class GameEvent
{
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    public Dictionary<string, int> ResourceEffects { get; set; }
    public string EducationalObjective { get; set; }
    public string RealWorldContext { get; set; }
    public List<string> LearningOutcomes { get; set; }
}
```

## üé® Child-Friendly Game Design

### Visual Design Principles
- **Large, Clear Buttons**: Easy interaction for 12-year-olds
- **Immediate Feedback**: Visual and audio responses to all actions
- **Progress Visualization**: Clear meters and progress bars
- **Emoji Integration**: Engaging, universal symbols
- **Color Psychology**: Encouraging, positive color schemes

### Animation Guidelines
```css
/* Game animation standards */
.dice-roll {
    animation: bounce 300ms ease-in-out;
    transform-origin: center;
}

.achievement-celebration {
    animation: celebrate 1000ms ease-out;
    /* Sparkles, confetti effects for positive reinforcement */
}

.resource-update {
    animation: countUp 500ms ease-in;
    /* Smooth number transitions for resource changes */
}
```

## üìä Educational Progression Tracking

### Learning Metrics
```csharp
public class EducationalProgress
{
    public int CountriesLearned { get; set; }
    public int LanguagesAttempted { get; set; }
    public int EconomicConceptsIntroduced { get; set; }
    public int StrategicDecisionsMade { get; set; }
    public float OverallEngagementScore { get; set; }
}
```

### Achievement System
- **Geography Master**: Learn about 10 different countries
- **Language Explorer**: Attempt pronunciation in 5 languages
- **Economic Strategist**: Successfully manage resources for 10 turns
- **World Leader**: Achieve maximum reputation through strategic play

## üîÑ Game State Management

### Educational State Tracking
```csharp
public class EducationalGameState
{
    public Player Player { get; set; }
    public List<Territory> AvailableTerritories { get; set; }
    public GameEvent CurrentEvent { get; set; }
    public List<EducationalObjective> ActiveLearningGoals { get; set; }
    public ProgressTracker LearningProgress { get; set; }
}
```

### Save System Design
- **Educational Continuity**: Preserve learning progress across sessions
- **Achievement Persistence**: Maintain educational accomplishments
- **Parent/Teacher Reports**: Optional progress sharing for educational oversight

## üåü Feature Development Patterns

### Educational Feature Template
```csharp
// Context: Educational game component for 12-year-old geography learning
// Educational Objective: Teach country recognition and economic concepts
// Safety Requirements: Age-appropriate content, positive messaging
// Real-World Connection: Actual GDP data and country information
public class EducationalGameComponent : ComponentBase
{
    [Parameter] public string LearningObjective { get; set; }
    [Parameter] public string RealWorldContext { get; set; }
    
    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        // Validate educational content
        // Apply safety filters
        // Initialize with encouraging messaging
    }
}
```
