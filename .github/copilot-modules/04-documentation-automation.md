# Copilot Module 4: Documentation & Knowledge Management
# Automatic documentation generation and maintenance patterns

## üìö Documentation Triggers

### Automatic Documentation Generation
Every code change should trigger appropriate documentation updates:

```csharp
// When creating new features, always include documentation metadata
[DocumentationMetadata(
    EducationalObjective = "Teaches dice probability and career progression",
    ChildSafetyLevel = "Verified - All outcomes positive and encouraging",
    TechnicalComplexity = "Intermediate",
    MaintenanceNotes = "Update job descriptions if game mechanics change"
)]
public class DiceRollComponent : ComponentBase
{
    // Implementation
}
```

### Documentation Workflow Triggers

#### 1. New Feature Implementation
```markdown
Trigger: Any new .cs, .razor, or .js file created
Action: Generate feature documentation in docs/_technical/
Template: 
- Educational objective
- Implementation details
- Child safety considerations
- Usage examples
- Maintenance notes
```

#### 2. Weekly Progress Updates
```markdown
Trigger: End of each development week
Action: Create week summary in docs/_journey/
Include:
- AI autonomy percentage
- Educational milestones achieved
- Technical accomplishments
- Child safety verifications
- Next week objectives
```

#### 3. Milestone Achievements
```markdown
Trigger: Major functionality completion
Action: Update docs/_milestones/
Content:
- Achievement summary
- Educational impact assessment
- Technical architecture evolution
- Child safety compliance verification
```

# .github/workflows/docs-quality-check.yml
name: Documentation Quality Check

on:
  pull_request:
    paths: ['docs/**']
    
jobs:
  docs-quality:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check Educational Objectives
        run: |
          # Ensure all new technical docs have educational objectives
          grep -r "educational_objective" docs/_technical/ || exit 1
          
      - name: Verify Child Safety Documentation
        run: |
          # Ensure child safety is addressed in all new content
          grep -r "child_safety_verified" docs/ || exit 1
          
      - name: Validate Documentation Structure
        run: |
          # Check frontmatter compliance
          ./docs/verify-structure.sh
```

Remember: Documentation should be as engaging and educational as the game itself!
Every piece of documentation should teach something valuable while maintaining professional standards.
