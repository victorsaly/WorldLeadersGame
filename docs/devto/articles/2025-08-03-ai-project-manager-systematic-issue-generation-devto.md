# AI as Project Manager: Automated Issue Generation That Actually Works

![AI Project Management Automation](https://docs.worldleadersgame.co.uk/assets/linkedin-images/ai-generated-issues-linkedin.png)

> **TL;DR**: AI systematically analyzed our chaotic documentation needs and generated 4 comprehensive GitHub issues with detailed implementation plans, effort estimates, and priority levels - achieving in minutes what would take human project managers hours of analysis and planning.

## The Project Management Crisis

Three weeks into our AI-first educational game development, we faced a classic project management nightmare:

- **46 markdown files** with inconsistent formatting
- **1,013-line AI instruction file** becoming counterproductive
- **Mobile responsiveness issues** affecting user experience
- **Dark mode visibility problems** hampering accessibility
- **Documentation scattered** across multiple directories

**Traditional approach**: Spend 2-3 days manually analyzing, planning, and creating issues.

**AI approach**: Let artificial intelligence systematically identify problems and generate comprehensive solutions.

**The result**: 4 perfectly structured GitHub issues ready for implementation.

## The AI Project Management Experiment

Instead of manually analyzing our project challenges, we fed our entire codebase context to Claude Sonnet 3.5 with this prompt:

```
Analyze the current state of our educational game documentation system.
Identify systematic issues that need resolution before Week 3.
Generate comprehensive GitHub issues with:
- Detailed problem analysis
- Implementation plans with timelines
- Success criteria and quality standards
- Effort estimates and priority levels
- Educational context preservation
```

**What happened next was remarkable.**
