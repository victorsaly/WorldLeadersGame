# 🚨 Azure Deployment Rollback Fix - World Leaders Game

## Issue Summary

**Error**: `The Resource 'Microsoft.Web/sites/worldleaders-web-prod/slots/production' under resource group 'worldleaders-prod-rg' was not found`

**Root Cause**: Incorrect understanding of Azure App Service slot structure in the rollback logic.

## The Problem

The GitHub Actions workflow was attempting to perform a rollback by swapping:
- **FROM**: `production` slot
- **TO**: `staging` slot

But this is incorrect because:
1. ❌ There is NO `production` slot - `production` is the main App Service itself
2. ❌ The rollback direction was backwards

## The Solution

### Correct Azure App Service Structure
```
worldleaders-web-prod (main production app)
├── Default slot (this IS production)
└── Staging slot: worldleaders-web-prod/slots/staging

worldleaders-api-prod (main production app)  
├── Default slot (this IS production)
└── Staging slot: worldleaders-api-prod/slots/staging
```

### Correct Rollback Logic
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT: Swap staging back to production
az webapp deployment slot swap \
  --resource-group "worldleaders-prod-rg" \
  --name "worldleaders-web-prod" \
  --slot staging \
  --target-slot production
```

## Immediate Fix Actions

### 1. Manual Rollback (Run Now)
```bash
# Make executable and run the quick fix
chmod +x scripts/quick-manual-rollback.sh
./scripts/quick-manual-rollback.sh
```

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow Fixed
The workflow file `.github/workflows/azure-deploy.yml` has been corrected with proper rollback logic.

### 3. Emergency Scripts Available
- `scripts/emergency-rollback-fix.sh` - Comprehensive rollback with diagnostics
- `scripts/quick-manual-rollback.sh` - Immediate rollback fix

## Educational Platform Context

This fix ensures:
- 🎮 **Zero Learning Disruption**: Quick rollback restores educational game for 12-year-old learners
- 🛡️ **Child Safety Maintained**: Previous working version preserves safety validations
- 📚 **Educational Continuity**: Geographic and economic learning features restored
- 🇬🇧 **UK Compliance**: GDPR and data residency requirements maintained

## Prevention for Future Deployments

### Fixed GitHub Actions Workflow
The corrected workflow now:
1. ✅ Uses correct slot swap direction: `staging` → `production`
2. ✅ Properly identifies Azure App Service structure
3. ✅ Maintains 30-second rollback target for educational platform
4. ✅ Preserves child safety validations during rollback

### Deployment Strategy Validation
```bash
# Validate slot structure before deployment
az webapp deployment slot list \
  --resource-group "worldleaders-prod-rg" \
  --name "worldleaders-web-prod" \
  --output table
```

## Verification Steps

After running the rollback:

1. **Check Game URL**: https://worldleaders-web-prod.azurewebsites.net
2. **Check API URL**: https://worldleaders-api-prod.azurewebsites.net  
3. **Verify Educational Features**: Geography learning, economics, language practice
4. **Confirm Child Safety**: Content moderation and age-appropriate design

## Azure Portal Links

- **Web App**: [Azure Portal - Web App](https://portal.azure.com/#@/resource/subscriptions/.../providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/worldleaders-web-prod)
- **API App**: [Azure Portal - API App](https://portal.azure.com/#@/resource/subscriptions/.../providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/worldleaders-api-prod)

## Key Learnings

1. **Azure Slot Structure**: Main app IS production, slots are sub-resources
2. **Rollback Direction**: Always swap FROM staging TO production  
3. **Educational Impact**: Quick rollback minimizes learning disruption
4. **Safety First**: Preserve child protection features during recovery
