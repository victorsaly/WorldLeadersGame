## üîß Technical Requirements

### Service Test Structure Pattern
```csharp
[TestClass]
public class GameEngineTests : ServiceTestBase
{
    private GameEngine _gameEngine;
    private Mock<WorldLeadersDbContext> _mockContext;
    private Mock<IDiceService> _mockDiceService;
    private Mock<ILogger<GameEngine>> _mockLogger;

    [TestInitialize]
    public void Setup()
    {
        SetupInMemoryDatabase();
        SetupEducationalTestData();
        ConfigureChildSafetyValidation();
        _gameEngine = new GameEngine(_mockContext.Object, _mockDiceService.Object, _mockLogger.Object);
    }

    [TestMethod]
    public async Task StartNewGame_WithValidPlayer_CreatesEducationalSession()
    {
        // Arrange - Educational player setup
        var playerId = await CreateTestPlayerAsync();
        
        // Act - Start educational game session
        var session = await _gameEngine.StartNewGameAsync(playerId);
        
        // Assert - Validate educational game state
        Assert.IsNotNull(session);
        Assert.AreEqual(GameState.InProgress, session.State);
        ValidateEducationalGameSetup(session);
        ValidateChildSafeInitialization(session);
    }
}
```

### Educational Validation Helpers
```csharp
protected void ValidateEducationalOutcome(object result, LearningObjective objective)
{
    // Learning objective achievement validation
    // Age-appropriate content verification
    // Real-world educational connection
    // Positive reinforcement presence
}

protected void ValidateChildSafeService<T>(T serviceResult)
{
    // Age-appropriate language validation
    // Cultural sensitivity verification
    // Educational value confirmation
    // Positive messaging requirement
}
```
