## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### AI Agent Service Framework

```csharp
// Context: Educational AI agents for 12-year-old safe learning interactions
// Educational Objective: Personalized learning through distinct AI personalities
// Safety Requirements: Maximum child protection with content validation
public interface IAIAgentService
{
    Task<AgentResponse> GenerateResponseAsync(
        AgentType agentType,
        GameContext context,
        string userInput);
    Task<bool> ValidateContentSafetyAsync(string content);
    Task<string> GetSafeFallbackResponseAsync(AgentType agentType);
    Task LogEducationalInteractionAsync(
        AgentType agentType,
        string userInput,
        string aiResponse,
        bool safetyValidationPassed);
}
```

### Agent Personality Definitions

```csharp
public class AIAgentPersonality
{
    public AgentType Type { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string EncouragingTrait { get; set; }  // "supportive", "enthusiastic", "patient"
    public string EducationalFocus { get; set; }  // Learning objective specialization
    public List<string> SafeResponseTemplates { get; set; }  // Emergency fallbacks
    public string PersonalityPrompt { get; set; }  // AI personality guidance
    public List<string> ProhibitedTopics { get; set; }  // Child safety boundaries
    public int MaxComplexityLevel { get; set; } = 3;  // Age-appropriate complexity (1-5)
}
```

### Content Validation Pipeline

```csharp
public class ChildSafetyContentValidator
{
    public async Task<SafetyValidationResult> ValidateAsync(string content)
    {
        var result = new SafetyValidationResult();

        // Layer 1: Azure Content Moderator
        result.ContentModerationPassed = await _azureContentModerator.AnalyzeAsync(content);

        // Layer 2: Educational Appropriateness
        result.EducationalValueConfirmed = await _educationalValidator.ValidateAsync(content);

        // Layer 3: Age-Appropriate Language
        result.AgeAppropriatenessPassed = await _ageValidator.ValidateAsync(content);

        // Layer 4: Cultural Sensitivity
        result.CulturalSensitivityPassed = await _culturalValidator.ValidateAsync(content);

        result.IsValid = result.ContentModerationPassed &&
                        result.EducationalValueConfirmed &&
                        result.AgeAppropriatenessPassed &&
                        result.CulturalSensitivityPassed;

        return result;
