## üîß Technical Architecture

### .NET 8 Optimizations
```csharp
// Primary constructors for cleaner dependency injection
public class JwtAuthenticationService(
    IConfiguration configuration,
    IMemoryCache cache,
    ILogger<JwtAuthenticationService> logger) : IJwtAuthenticationService
{
    // Implementation with .NET 8 performance improvements
}

// Record types for immutable configuration
public record AzureAdB2CConfig(
    string TenantId,
    string ClientId,
    string Authority,
    string Region = "UK South"
);
```

### Azure AD B2C Configuration
- **Region**: UK South for data residency compliance
- **Child Safety**: Minimal data collection (username, age group only)
- **Parental Controls**: Optional oversight and progress sharing
- **Performance**: Token validation optimized for <50ms response times

### Per-User Cost Tracking
```csharp
// Granular cost attribution per learner
public record UserCostValidation(
    bool IsAllowed,
    decimal EstimatedCost,
    decimal RemainingDailyBudget,
    string? SuggestedAction = null
);
```
