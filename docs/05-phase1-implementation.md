### Task 1.3: Core Domain Models
**Objective**: Implement essential domain models for educational game functionality

**Models to Create**:

**Player Model** (`WorldLeaders.Shared/Models/Player.cs`):
```csharp
public class Player
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public string Username { get; set; }
    public int Income { get; set; }
    public int Reputation { get; set; }      // 0-100%
    public int Happiness { get; set; }       // 0-100%
    public JobLevel CurrentJob { get; set; }
    public List<Territory> OwnedTerritories { get; set; }
    public DateTime CreatedAt { get; set; }
    public DateTime UpdatedAt { get; set; }
}
```

**Territory Model** (`WorldLeaders.Shared/Models/Territory.cs`):
```csharp
public class Territory
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public string CountryName { get; set; }
    public string CountryCode { get; set; }
    public decimal GdpInBillions { get; set; }
    public int Cost { get; set; }
    public int ReputationRequired { get; set; }
    public List<string> OfficialLanguages { get; set; }
}
```

**Enumerations** (`WorldLeaders.Shared/Enums/`):
```csharp
public enum JobLevel
{
    Farmer = 1,
    Gardener = 2,
    Shopkeeper = 3,
    Artisan = 4,
    Politician = 5,
    BusinessLeader = 6
}

public enum AgentType
{
    CareerGuide,
    EventNarrator,
    FortuneTeller,
    HappinessAdvisor,
    TerritoryStrategist,
    LanguageTutor
}
```

### Task 1.4: Entity Framework Configuration
**Objective**: Set up Entity Framework Core with PostgreSQL for educational game data persistence

**Database Setup Requirements**:
- Create `GameDbContext` in `WorldLeaders.Infrastructure/Data/`
- Configure entity relationships and constraints
- Implement audit fields (CreatedAt, UpdatedAt) for all entities
- Set up soft delete patterns with IsDeleted flag
- Create initial migration with territory seed data

**Key Configurations**:
- Guid primary keys for all entities
- JSON column support for complex game state
- Territory seed data with real GDP information
- Connection string configuration for development/production

### Task 1.5: .NET Aspire Orchestration
**Objective**: Configure .NET Aspire in AppHost for local development orchestration

**Orchestration Requirements**:
- Register PostgreSQL database service
- Set up Redis for session state and caching
- Configure Web application (Blazor Server)
- Register API application with proper service discovery
- Health checks for all services
- Development environment optimization

## ðŸŽ® Educational Game Considerations

### Child Safety Requirements
- All code must be appropriate for 12-year-old players
- Input validation and sanitization for user-generated content
- Content moderation preparation for AI responses
- Privacy-first data handling patterns

### Educational Objectives
- Territory pricing based on real-world GDP data
- Language learning integration preparation
- Cultural sensitivity in country representation
- Learning progression tracking capabilities

### Performance Targets
- Page load times under 2 seconds
- API response times under 500ms
- Real-time SignalR communication optimization
- Mobile-responsive design for tablet usage

## ðŸ¤– AI-First Development Approach

### GitHub Copilot Integration
All Phase 1 tasks should be completed using GitHub Copilot Chat with comprehensive context from:
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Complete development guidelines
- Domain model specifications above
- Educational game design patterns
- Child safety and performance requirements

### Prompt-Driven Development
Each task includes specific prompts designed for GitHub Copilot Chat to generate contextually appropriate educational game code following established patterns.

### Quality Assurance
- Solution must compile without errors
- All projects must follow naming conventions
- Educational patterns must be consistently applied
- Child safety considerations must be implemented
