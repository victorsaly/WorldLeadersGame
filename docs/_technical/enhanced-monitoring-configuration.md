# Enhanced Monitoring Configuration - Educational Platform

## üéØ Educational Objective

Ensure reliable, safe, and performant educational experience for 12-year-old learners through comprehensive application monitoring.

## üåç Real-World Connection

Professional platform monitoring ensures consistent learning availability and validates that educational technology meets child-friendly performance standards.

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Issue Resolution

**Problem**: Application Insights component name mismatch in GitHub workflow

- **Expected**: `worldleaders-prod-uksouth-insights`
- **Actual**: `worldleaders-prod-insights`

**Solution**: Updated workflow configuration and created enhanced monitoring script.

### Monitoring Configuration

```bash
# Key Performance Targets for Child-Friendly Experience
TARGET_RESPONSE_TIME_MS=1500  # < 1.5 seconds for child engagement
TARGET_AVAILABILITY=99.5      # High availability for continuous learning
RETENTION_DAYS=90             # Educational compliance retention
```

### Application Insights Setup

```bash
# Configure retention for educational compliance
az monitor app-insights component update \
    --resource-group "worldleaders-prod-rg" \
    --app "worldleaders-prod-insights" \
    --retention-time 90
```

### Performance Alerts

1. **Response Time Alert**: Monitors response times < 1500ms for child engagement
2. **Availability Alert**: Ensures >99.5% uptime for continuous learning
3. **Error Rate Alert**: Tracks application errors affecting child experience
