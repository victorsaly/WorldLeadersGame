# Azure Deployment Authentication Fix

**Issue**: GitHub Actions failing with "Unable to get ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL env variable" and "Please make sure to give write permissions to id-token in the workflow."

**Root Cause**: The Azure login action requires OIDC (OpenID Connect) authentication with proper workflow permissions and federated credentials.

## üîß Solution Applied

### 1. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow
Added required permissions:
```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read
```

Changed authentication from:
```yaml
- name: üîê Azure Login
  uses: azure/login@v1
  with:
    creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
```

To modern OIDC approach:
```yaml
- name: üîê Azure Login
  uses: azure/login@v1
  with:
    client-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
    tenant-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}
    subscription-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}
```

## üîß Solution Applied

### 1. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow
Changed from:
```yaml
- name: üîê Azure Login
  uses: azure/login@v1
  with:
    creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
```

To:
```yaml
- name: üîê Azure Login
  uses: azure/login@v1
  with:
    client-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
    tenant-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}
    subscription-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}
```

### 2. Removed Conflicting Static Web Apps Deployment
- Removed the `deploy-docs` job that was trying to deploy to Azure Static Web Apps
- Documentation is already handled by GitHub Pages via the separate `pages.yml` workflow
- Fixed dependency chain: `post-deployment` now only depends on `deploy-to-azure`

### 3. Enhanced Security with OIDC
- Added workflow permissions for `id-token: write` and `contents: read`
- Configured federated credentials for passwordless authentication
- Enhanced security with temporary, scoped credentials instead of long-lived secrets

### 4. Required GitHub Secrets

You need to add these three secrets to your GitHub repository:

| Secret Name | Description | How to Get |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | Service Principal Client ID | From `az ad sp create-for-rbac` output |
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | Azure AD Tenant ID | From `az ad sp create-for-rbac` output |
| `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | Azure Subscription ID | From `az account show --query id` |

### 3. Automated Setup Script

Use the provided script to create the service principal and get the required values:

```bash
./scripts/setup-github-azure-secrets.sh
```

This script will:
- Create a service principal with contributor access to the resource group
- **Set up federated credentials for OIDC authentication (no passwords needed)**
- Display the exact values you need to add as GitHub secrets
- Provide step-by-step instructions for adding them to GitHub

**Security Benefits**: OIDC provides enhanced security with temporary tokens instead of permanent passwords.

## üéØ Educational Context

**Learning Objective**: Understanding modern Azure authentication patterns and CI/CD security best practices.

**Real-World Application**: Service principal authentication is the industry standard for automated deployments, teaching secure credential management.

**Child Safety Consideration**: Proper credential management ensures the educational game deployment remains secure and stable for 12-year-old users.

## üÜï OIDC Subject Claim Fix (August 5, 2025)

**New Issue Identified**: Federated identity credential subject claim mismatch
```
Error: No matching federated identity record found for presented assertion subject 
'repo:victorsaly/WorldLeadersGame:environment:production'
```

**Root Cause**: The GitHub workflow uses `environment: production` which creates a different subject claim than expected.

**Subject Claim Formats**:
- ‚ùå **Old (Main Branch)**: `repo:victorsaly/WorldLeadersGame:ref:refs/heads/main`
- ‚úÖ **New (Environment)**: `repo:victorsaly/WorldLeadersGame:environment:production`

**Quick Fix Available**:
```bash
# Run the OIDC credential fix script
./scripts/fix-azure-oidc-credential.sh
```

This script will:
1. Find your existing service principal
2. Remove the old federated credential (if exists)
3. Create a new credential with the correct subject claim
4. Verify the configuration

## ‚úÖ Verification

After adding the secrets, the GitHub Actions workflow should:
1. ‚úÖ Authenticate successfully with Azure
2. ‚úÖ Deploy the Web App to `worldleaders-web-prod`
3. ‚úÖ Deploy the API to `worldleaders-api-prod`
4. ‚úÖ Configure proper .NET 8 runtime settings
