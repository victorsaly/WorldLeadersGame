# Proj### The Original Spark ⚡

It all began with my 12-year-old son's passionate discussion at home in London after school, where his geography and economics lessons had sparked an exciting idea:

> _"Dad, imagine a game where you start as a peasant and work your way up to world leader, but you have to keep everyone happy and learn about real countries. You could buy Canada when you get 25% reputation!"_

That conversation became the foundation for "World Leaders Game" — an ambitious educational strategy game built almost entirely through AI autonomy, with our father-son collaboration guiding the creative vision whilst human intervention occurs only when absolutely necessary.rview: World Leaders Game 🌍👑

## 🎯 The Vision

**From a 5-minute voice memo to a production-ready educational game in 18 weeks using AI-led development.**

### The Original Spark ⚡

It all began with my 12-year-old son's passionate description during a car ride:

> _"Dad, imagine a game where you start as a peasant and work your way up to world leader, but you have to keep everyone happy and learn about real countries. You could buy Canada when you get 25% reputation!"_

That voice memo became the foundation for "World Leaders Game" — an ambitious educational strategy game built almost entirely through AI autonomy, with human intervention only when absolutely necessary.

### The Child Designer's Vision 🎨

My son didn't stop at the initial discussion. He independently took creative ownership and:

- **Created hand-drawn mockups** showing his exact vision for each game phase
- **Designed the logo in Figma** with a compass/directional theme
- **Defined the visual language** with colours, layouts, and interactive elements

This became a true father-son collaboration where his creative vision drives the entire development process.
