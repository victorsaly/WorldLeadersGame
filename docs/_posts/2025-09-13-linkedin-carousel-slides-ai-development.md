## üõ†Ô∏è Slide Generation Workflow

### Step 1: Create Individual Slides

Use each prompt above with your existing AI image generation system:

```bash
# Generate each slide using your current setup
./scripts/generate-image.py --prompt-file "slide-1-title.md" --output "linkedin-carousel-slide-1.png"
./scripts/generate-image.py --prompt-file "slide-2-agents.md" --output "linkedin-carousel-slide-2.png"
./scripts/generate-image.py --prompt-file "slide-3-testing.md" --output "linkedin-carousel-slide-3.png"
./scripts/generate-image.py --prompt-file "slide-4-context.md" --output "linkedin-carousel-slide-4.png"
./scripts/generate-image.py --prompt-file "slide-5-reality.md" --output "linkedin-carousel-slide-5.png"
./scripts/generate-image.py --prompt-file "slide-6-framework.md" --output "linkedin-carousel-slide-6.png"
```

### Step 2: PDF Assembly

```bash
# Convert individual slides to PDF carousel
# You can use tools like:
# - Adobe Acrobat
# - PowerPoint export
# - Online PDF merge tools
# - ImageMagick: convert slide-*.png linkedin-carousel.pdf
```

### Step 3: LinkedIn Optimization

- **Upload as PDF**: LinkedIn supports PDF carousels
- **Individual Images**: Also save as individual PNGs for flexibility
- **Mobile Preview**: Test readability on mobile devices
- **Text Legibility**: Ensure all text is readable at small sizes

## üìä Content Strategy Integration

### LinkedIn Post to Accompany Carousel

```
üöÄ AI Driven Development Day 2025 brought together industry leaders to share game-changing insights about strategic AI adoption.

Here are the 5 key takeaways every technology leader needs to know üëÜ

The biggest revelation? We're moving beyond "AI chat moments" to strategic AI partnerships that understand your entire codebase and execute complex operations autonomously.

But there's a reality check: while we expect 24% productivity improvements, we actually experience 19% slower performance initially. The key is strategic adoption focused on invariant human needs rather than trending tools.

Swipe through for actionable insights from @debbie_obrien @philnash @kentcdodds @tejaskumar and other industry leaders.

What's your experience with moving beyond basic AI chat to strategic implementation?
