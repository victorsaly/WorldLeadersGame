üöÄ AI generated 4 comprehensive GitHub issues in 50 minutes that would take human project managers 14 hours to create.

Most project management is still manual analysis, issue creation, and timeline planning. It's time-consuming and often misses systematic problems.

We fed our entire codebase to AI with structured prompts and business context. The result? Perfectly formatted issues with implementation plans, effort estimates, and educational context preservation.

üìä Results:
‚Ä¢ 92% time reduction (14 hours ‚Üí 50 minutes)
‚Ä¢ 4 implementation-ready issues with detailed plans
‚Ä¢ 100% business alignment through iterative refinement

The key? Multiple refinement cycles and comprehensive business context. AI doesn't replace project management expertise‚Äîit amplifies it.

What project management tasks do you think AI could systematically improve?
