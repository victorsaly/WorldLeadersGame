## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Game State Architecture

```csharp
// Core game entities and state management
public class GameState
{
    public Dictionary<string, Territory> Territories { get; set; }
    public List<Player> Players { get; set; }
    public int CurrentTurn { get; set; }
    public GamePhase Phase { get; set; }
}

public class Territory
{
    public string Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public Player Owner { get; set; }
    public int Population { get; set; }
    public int Resources { get; set; }
    public List<string> AdjacentTerritories { get; set; }
}
```

### Blazor Map Component

```razor
@* Interactive world map component *@
<div class="world-map-container">
    <svg viewBox="0 0 1000 500" class="world-map">
        @foreach (var territory in GameState.Territories.Values)
        {
            <path d="@territory.SvgPath"
                  class="territory @territory.GetCssClass()"
                  @onclick="() => SelectTerritory(territory)"
                  @onmouseover="() => ShowTerritoryInfo(territory)">
            </path>
        }
    </svg>
</div>
```
