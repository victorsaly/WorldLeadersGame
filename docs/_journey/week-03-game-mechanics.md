## üéÆ Game Mechanics Deep Dive

### Dice-Based Career Progression

The heart of our educational system uses dice mechanics to teach career development:

#### Job Level Mapping
- **Dice 1-2**: Basic Jobs (Farmer $30K, Gardener $35K)
- **Dice 3-4**: Skilled Jobs (Shopkeeper $50K, Artisan $65K)
- **Dice 5-6**: Leadership (Politician $100K, Business Leader $150K)

#### Educational Messaging Examples
- **Rolling 1**: "üå± Farming teaches us where food comes from! +5 Happiness"
- **Rolling 6**: "üèÜ Leadership skills are amazing! +20 Reputation"

### Resource Management System

#### Three Core Resources
1. **Income ($)**: Monthly earnings from career progression
2. **Reputation (0-100%)**: Trust level affecting territory purchase discounts
3. **Happiness (0-100%)**: Population satisfaction influencing game events

#### Visual Progress Tracking
- Real-time progress bars with smooth animations
- Color-coded indicators (green = good, orange = needs attention)
- Educational tooltips explaining each resource's importance
