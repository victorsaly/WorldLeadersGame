## 💭 Week 7 Strategic Notes

### Human Leadership Transition
The transition from AI-led implementation to human-led architecture represents a natural evolution in the development process. Week 6 demonstrated that AI can achieve technical excellence when given clear context and objectives. Week 7 focuses on areas where human insight, creativity, and educational understanding provide the greatest value.

### Educational Game Design Philosophy
The emphasis on human-led game architecture reflects the reality that educational effectiveness requires understanding of how children learn, what motivates them, and how to structure experiences that are both engaging and instructive. While AI can implement designs with exceptional quality, the design itself benefits from human educational insight.

### Collaborative Success Pattern
The Week 6 success pattern (95% AI autonomy with human strategic guidance) provides a template for Week 7 execution. Clear human vision and objectives enable AI to deliver exceptional implementation, while human oversight ensures educational and quality standards are maintained.
