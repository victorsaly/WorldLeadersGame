### Claude Sonnet 3.5: Strategic Guidance

**Role**: Architecture validation, educational content oversight, problem-solving guidance  
**Autonomy Level**: 95% (Self-directed problem solving and optimization suggestions)

#### **Key Strategic Contributions**

##### **Aspire Orchestration Problem Solving**

When initial PostgreSQL hosting failed, Claude autonomously:

1. **Identified Issue**: Missing `Aspire.Hosting.PostgreSQL` package
2. **Provided Solution**: Exact NuGet package and configuration code
3. **Validated Result**: Confirmed successful build and database connection

##### **Educational Game Balance Recommendations**

```markdown
Territory Acquisition Balance Analysis:

- Nepal ($5K, 10% reputation): Perfect starter territory for new players
- Canada ($50K, 40% reputation): Mid-game strategic acquisition
- USA ($200K, 85% reputation): Endgame challenge requiring mastery

This progression teaches economic scale while maintaining achievable goals
for 12-year-old players at each skill level.
```

##### **Child Safety Architecture Validation**
