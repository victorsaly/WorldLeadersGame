# Week 5: Production Security & Authentication

_Securing 1000+ Young Learners with Child-Safe Authentication_

## üéØ Educational Mission

This week focused on implementing comprehensive authentication and security features specifically designed for educational platforms serving children. The system needed to balance robust security with COPPA/GDPR compliance while maintaining an engaging experience for 12-year-old learners.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Achievements

### üîê JWT Authentication with .NET 8 Primary Constructors

Implemented a modern authentication service using .NET 8's primary constructor pattern:

```csharp
public class JwtAuthenticationService(
    UserManager<ApplicationUser> userManager,
    SignInManager<ApplicationUser> signInManager,
    IChildSafetyValidator childSafetyValidator,
    IPerUserCostTracker costTracker,
    IOptions<JwtOptions> jwtOptions,
    IOptions<ChildSafetyOptions> childSafetyOptions,
    WorldLeadersDbContext dbContext,
    ILogger<JwtAuthenticationService> logger) : IAuthenticationService
{
    public required AzureAdB2COptions B2CConfig { get; init; } = AzureAdB2COptions.UKEducationalDefaults;
    public required string Region { get; init; } = "UK South";
    public required decimal MaxCostPerUser { get; init; } = 0.08m; // ¬£0.08/user/day limit
}
```

**Key Innovation**: Used .NET 8's streamlined dependency injection pattern while maintaining comprehensive initialization validation.

### üåç Azure AD B2C Integration (UK South Region)

Configured for UK educational data residency requirements:

```json
{
  "AzureAdB2C": {
    "Region": "UK South",
    "SignUpSignInPolicyId": "B2C_1_susi_educational",
    "ResetPasswordPolicyId": "B2C_1_pwd_reset_educational",
    "EditProfilePolicyId": "B2C_1_profile_edit_educational"
  }
}
```

**Educational Impact**: Ensures compliance with UK education sector data protection requirements.

### üí∞ Per-User Cost Tracking (¬£0.08/User/Day)

Implemented granular cost attribution across Azure services:

```csharp
public async Task<UserCostSummaryDto> TrackUsageAsync(Guid userId, string serviceType, decimal estimatedCost)
{
    // Track AI, Speech, and Content Moderation costs separately
    // Enforce daily limit of ¬£0.08 per user
    // Generate detailed cost breakdowns for administrators
}
```

**Business Value**: Enables precise cost control for educational budgets while maintaining service quality.

### üõ°Ô∏è Child Safety Validation Framework

Created comprehensive COPPA/GDPR compliance system:

```csharp
public class ChildSafetyValidator : IChildSafetyValidator
{
    public async Task<ChildSafetyValidationResponse> ValidateRegistrationAsync(RegisterUserRequest request)
    {
        // Age verification and parental consent validation
        // Content appropriateness checking
        // GDPR compliance enforcement
        // Comprehensive audit trail logging
    }
}
```

**Safety Features**:

- Automatic parental consent for users under 13
- Enhanced session timeouts for child accounts (30 minutes vs 120 minutes)
- Content validation for usernames and display names
- Comprehensive audit logging for compliance

## üîß Implementation Details

### Authentication Models

Enhanced the domain model with comprehensive user management:

```csharp
public class ApplicationUser : IdentityUser<Guid>
{
    public required string DisplayName { get; set; }
    public required DateTime DateOfBirth { get; set; }
    public string? ParentalEmail { get; set; }
    public bool HasParentalConsent { get; set; }
    public bool HasGdprConsent { get; set; }
    public UserRole Role { get; set; } = UserRole.Student;

    public bool IsChild => CalculateAge() < 13;
    public bool RequiresChildSafety => IsChild || Role == UserRole.Student;
}
```

### Database Schema Updates

Extended the Entity Framework context to support Identity framework:

```csharp
public class WorldLeadersDbContext : IdentityDbContext<ApplicationUser, IdentityRole<Guid>, Guid>
{
    public DbSet<UserSession> UserSessions { get; set; }
    public DbSet<UserCostTracking> UserCostTracking { get; set; }
    public DbSet<ChildSafetyAudit> ChildSafetyAudits { get; set; }
}
```

### Authorization Policies

Implemented role-based access control with educational context:

```csharp
services.AddAuthorization(options =>
{
    options.AddPolicy("StudentPolicy", policy => policy.RequireRole("Student"));
    options.AddPolicy("TeacherPolicy", policy => policy.RequireRole("Teacher", "Admin"));
    options.AddPolicy("ChildSafetyPolicy", policy => policy.RequireClaim("IsChild", "true"));
    options.AddPolicy("AdultSupervisionPolicy", policy => /* Enhanced validation for sensitive operations */);
});
```

## üìä Educational Compliance Features
