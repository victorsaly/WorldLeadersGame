## Issue: Fix missing Application Insights resource for Azure deployment

**Description:**
The deployment workflow ([view logs](https://github.com/victorsaly/WorldLeadersGame/actions/runs/16860052287/job/47759420905#step:4:1)) failed due to a missing Application Insights resource. Observations:

1. The resource `Microsoft.Insights/components/worldleaders-prod-uksouth-insights` under the resource group `worldleaders-prod-rg` could not be found.
2. The workflow attempted to install the `application-insights` extension dynamically but encountered warnings about preview versions.
3. The process exited with error code `3`.

**Action Items:**
- Verify if the resource `worldleaders-prod-uksouth-insights` exists in the Azure portal.
- Ensure the resource is created and properly configured under the group `worldleaders-prod-rg`.
- Update the workflow to handle missing resources gracefully.
- Consider explicitly installing the `application-insights` extension with the appropriate flags to avoid dynamic installation during deployment.
